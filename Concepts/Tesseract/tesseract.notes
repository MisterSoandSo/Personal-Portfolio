Tesseract has different Page Segmentation Modes (PSM) that control how it detects text layout. Since your text is vertical Chinese, you should experiment with these settings:

PSM 5: Treat the image as a single vertical column of text.
PSM 6: Assume a uniform block of text.
PSM 7: Single text line.
PSM 11: Sparse text with vertical writing.
